# Quoridor AI Project
A project in python focused on developing an intelligent AI opponent for the board game Quoridor, a game easy to learn but with strategic depth.

## Project Goals
* Core Game Logic: Implement the rules and mechanics of Quoridor faithfully.
* AI Development: Design and train an AI player that makes strategic moves and adapts to different playstyles.
* Human Play: Create a basic interface (text-based or simple graphics) to allow human vs. AI gameplay.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x


## Game Rules
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor

## Project Status
* Early Development: Project structure established, and core game logic is under development.
* AI Research: Exploring AI strategies and algorithms suitable for Quoridor (e.g., Minimax, Monte Carlo Tree Search, etc.)

## Future Goals
* Difficulty Levels: Implement different AI difficulty settings.
* Machine Learning: Explore training the AI through self-play or reinforcement learning.
* A userfriendly UI
